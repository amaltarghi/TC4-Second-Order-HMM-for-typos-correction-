the leftist is too far gone for that his feelings of inferiority are so ingrained that he cannot conceive of himself as individually strong and valuable hence the collectivism of the leftist he can feel strong only as a member of a large organization or a mass movement with which he identifies himself notice the masochistic tendency of leftist tactics leftists protest by lying down in front of vehicles they intentionally provoke police or racists to abuse them etc these tactics may often be effective but many leftists use them not as a means to an end but because they prefer masochistic tactics self hatred is a leftist trait leftists may claim that their activism is motivated by compassion or by moral principle and moral principle does play a role for the leftist of the oversocialized type but compassion and moral principle cannot be the main motives for leftist activism hostility is too prominent a component of leftist behavior so is the drive for power moreover much leftist behavior is not rationally calculated to be of benefit to the people whom the leftists claim to be trying to help for example if one believes that affirmative action is good for black people does it make sense to demand affirmative action in hostile or dogmatic terms obviously it would be more productive to take a diplomatic and conciliatory approach that would make at least verbal and symbolic concessions to white people who think that affirmative action discriminates against them but leftist activists do not take such an approach because it would not satisfy their emotional needs helping black people is not their real goal instead race problems serve as an excuse for them to express their own hostility and frustrated need for power in doing so they actually harm black people because the activists hostile attitude toward the white majority tends to intensify race hatred if our society had no social problems at all the leftists would have to invent problems in order to provide themselves with an excuse for making a fuss we emphasize that the foregoing does not pretend to be an accurate description of everyone who might be considered a leftist it is only a rough indication of a general tendency of leftism oversocialization psychologists use the term socialization to designate the process by which children are trained to think and act as society demands a person is said to be well socialized if he believes in and obeys the moral code of his society and fits in well as a functioning part of that society it may seem senseless to say that many leftists are over socialized since the leftist is perceived as a rebel nevertheless the position can be defended many leftists are not such rebels as they seem the moral code of our society is so demanding that no one can think feel and act in a completely moral way for example we are not supposed to hate anyone yet almost everyone hates somebody at some time or other whether he admits it to himself or not some people are so highly socialized that the attempt to think feel and act morally imposes a severe burden on them in order to avoid feelings of guilt they continually have to deceive themselves about their own motives and find moral explanations for feelings and actions that in reality have a non moral origin we use the term oversocialized to describe such people oversocialization can lead to low self esteem a sense of powerlessness defeatism guilt etc one of the most important means by which our society socializes children is by making them feel ashamed of behavior or speech that is contrary to society s expectations if this is overdone or if a particular child is especially susceptible to such feelings he ends by feeling ashamed of himself moreover the thought and the behavior of the oversocialized person are more restricted by society s expectations than are those of the lightly socialized person the majority of people engage in a significant amount of naughty behavior they lie they commit petty thefts they break traffic laws they goof off at work they hate someone they say spiteful things or they use some underhanded trick to get ahead of the other guy the oversocialized person cannot do these things or if he does do them he generates in himself a sense of shame and self hatred the oversocialized person cannot even experience without guilt thoughts or feelings that are contrary to the accepted morality he cannot think unclean thoughts and socialization is not just a matter of morality we are socialized to confirm to many norms of behavior that do not fall under the heading of morality thus the oversocialized person is kept on a psychological leash and spends his life running on rails that society has laid down for him in many oversocialized people this results in a sense of constraint and powerlessness that can be a severe hardship we suggest that oversocialization is among the more serious cruelties that human beings inflict on one another we argue that a very important and influential segment of the modern left is oversocialized and that their oversocialization is of great importance in determining the direction of modern leftism leftists of the oversocialized type tend to be intellectuals or members of the upper middle class notice that university intellectuals constitute the most highly socialized segment of our society and also the most left wing segment the leftist of the oversocialized type tries to get off his psychological leash and assert his autonomy by rebelling but usually he is not strong enough to rebel against the most basic values of society generally speaking the goals of today s leftists are not in conflict with the accepted morality on the contrary the left takes an accepted moral principle adopts it as its own and then accuses mainstream society of violating that principle examples racial equality equality of the sexes helping poor people peace as opposed to war nonviolence generally freedom of expression kindness to animals more fundamentally the duty of the individual to serve society and the duty of society to take care of the individual all these have been deeply rooted values of our society or at least of its middle and upper classes for a long time these values are explicitly or implicitly expressed or presupposed in most of the material presented to us by the mainstream communications media and the educational system leftists especially those of the oversocialized type usually do not rebel against these principles but justify their hostility to society by claiming with some degree of truth that society is not living up to these principles here is an illustration of the way in which the oversocialized leftist shows his real attachment to the conventional attitudes of our society while pretending to be in rebellion against it many leftists push for affirmative action for moving black people into high prestige jobs for improved education in black schools and more money for such schools the way of life of the black underclass they regard as a social disgrace they want to integrate the black man into the system make him a business executive a lawyer a scientist just like upper middle class white people the leftists will reply that the last thing they want is to make the black man into a copy of the white man instead they want to preserve african american culture but in what does this preservation of african american culture consist it can hardly consist in anything more than eating black style food listening to black style music wearing black style clothing and going to a black style church or mosque in other words it can express itself only in superficial matters in all essential respects more leftists of the oversocialized type want to make the black man conform to white middle class ideals they want to make him study technical subjects become an executive or a scientist spend his life climbing the status ladder to prove that black people are as good as white they want to make black fathers responsible they want black gangs to become nonviolent etc but these are exactly the values of the industrial technological system the system couldn t care less what kind of music a man listens to what kind of clothes he wears or what religion he believes in as long as he studies in school holds a respectable job climbs the status ladder is a responsible parent is nonviolent and so forth in effect however much he may deny it the oversocialized leftist wants to integrate the black man into the system and make him adopt its values we certainly do not claim that leftists even of the oversocialized type never rebel against the fundamental values of our society clearly they sometimes do some oversocialized leftists have gone so far as to rebel against one of modern society s most important principles by engaging in physical violence
